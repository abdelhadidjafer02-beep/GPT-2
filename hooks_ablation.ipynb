        "The ablation experiment has completed, and we can now see the impact of each attention head on the prediction of ' jumps'.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Significant Drops:** Some heads, like `L0H8` (a -42.21% change, dropping probability to 4.86%), `L0H7` (a -29.78% change, dropping probability to 17.29%), and `L11H0` (a -30.83% change, dropping probability to 16.24%), caused very large decreases in the probability of predicting ' jumps'. This suggests these heads are crucial for the model's ability to perform the copying task.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Significant Increases:** Conversely, some heads, such as `L2H8` (a +31.01% change, increasing probability to 78.08%), `L2H3` (a +20.11% change, increasing probability to 67.18%), and `L7H10` (a +19.87% change, increasing probability to 66.94%), led to a substantial *increase* in the probability. This indicates these heads might normally be suppressing the correct prediction or are involved in other less direct mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mixed Impact:** Many other heads caused smaller positive or negative changes, suggesting they contribute to the task to varying degrees, or their roles are less direct.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis helps us pinpoint specific attention heads that are critical for the model's behavior in this proxy task. The original hypothesis focused on middle layers, and while some of those are important, we also see critical heads in earlier (L0) and later (L11) layers."
